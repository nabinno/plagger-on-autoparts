# Contributing to Autoparts

### Getting Started

Before building a new part ensure you have updated the repo. Run `parts update` within your Nitrous box in order to do this.

### Package Guidelines

Autoparts packages are located in `lib/autoparts/packages`. Please follow the [Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) when building a part.

In order to create a new package you will need to provide the following information when creating a pull request:

* Package Name
* Version
* Description
* Category (A list of categories can be found within [lib/autoparts/category.rb](https://github.com/nitrous-io/autoparts/blob/master/lib/autoparts/category.rb))
* Source URL (official release source which package will always be located at)
* Source filetype (the extension of the source file)
* SHA-1 hash of the source package (You can run `sha1sum` against the source file or [generate](http://hash.online-convert.com/sha1-generator) a SHA-1 hash with the source file)
* Dependencies (if any)
* Compile / Installation commands
* (Optional) Start/Stop commands. This is needed only if building a part for a database or another tool that runs as a service.

There are a few requirements if the part requires additional configuration:

* Post-installation setup tasks (e.g. creating conf file, generating empty database file) should be done in `post_install` method.
* Configuration files should be placed in `Path.etc` (e.g. `~/.parts/etc`) or `Path.etc + name` (e.g. `~/.parts/etc/postgresql`).
* Data files (e.g. database files) should be placed in `Path.var + name` (e.g. `~/.parts/var/postgresql`).
* Log files should be placed in `Path.var + 'log' + "#{name}.log"` (e.g. `~/.parts/var/log/postgresql.log`).

### Contributing a New Part

Take a look at [docs/example-part.rb](https://github.com/nitrous-io/autoparts/tree/master/docs/example-part.rb) for details on how a package is built.

Follow this workflow to contribute an Autoparts package:

1. Fork the [Autoparts repo](https://github.com/nitrous-io/autoparts) in GitHub.
2. Create a new box in Nitrous.IO.
3. cd to `~/.parts/autoparts`
4. Add the fork repo as a a git remote: `git remote add myfork git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/autoparts.git`
5. Create the new package file in `~/.parts/autoparts/lib/autoparts/packages/mypackage.rb`
6. Open a new console tab and check if the package works as expected.
  * parts search (see if the new package you created is listed)
  * parts install mypackage
  * parts start (if applicable)
  * parts stop
  * parts uninstall mypackage
7. Reload the IDE and see if the above actions also works via the UI.
8. After you're confident that the package works, commit and push the change to your fork.
  * git commit -m "Added MyPackage."
  * git push myfork master
9. Last, open a pull request via GitHub with a [descriptive commit message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message). We will quickly review the part to be merged.
